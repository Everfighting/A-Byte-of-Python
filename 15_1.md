__init__(self, ...)

This method is called just before the newly created object is returned for usage.

__del__(self)

Called just before the object is destroyed (which has unpredictable timing, so avoid
using this)

__str__(self)

Called when we use the print function or when str() is used.

__lt__(self, other)

Called when the less than operator (<) is used. Similarly, there are special methods
for all the operators (+, >, etc.) __add__, __gt__

__getitem__(self, key)

Called when x[key] indexing operation is used.

__len__(self)

Called when the built-in len() function is used for the sequence object.
